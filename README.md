# Digital-Marketing
A portfolio of the digital marketing projects I have done to date, including a portfolio of projects completed for Udacity's Digital Marketing Nanodegree and Business Analytics Nanodegree certifications.
# 1. B2B Market Preparation
In this project, I designed the marketing objective, KPI, and value proposition for Udacity's Enterprise training program and conducted a survey, designed an empathy map, and created a target persona from interview data.
# 2. Marketing Myself
For this effort, I created a marketing strategy for myself, creating a blog post to highlight my reasons for pivoting from a career in management consulting to digital marketing.
# 3. Facebook Ad Campaign (Part 1)
I designed a B2B marketing approach to target professionals interested in digital marketing training programs for their organization using Facebook Ads Manager.
# 4. Facebook Ad Campaign (Part 2)
In the second part of this campaign, I analyzed and presented campaign metrics against the marketing objective and KPI to assess the effectiveness of my marketing approach.
# 5. SEO Audit
This project highlights my experience in planning an SEO audit through identification of target keywords, analysis of site metadata, identication of prospects for backlinks, and site performance testing (mobile and desktop).
# 6. SEM Google Ads Campaign
For this effort, I created and analyzed a Google Ads campaign with two ad groups to generate new leads to one of the free computer programming courses offered by Udacity.
