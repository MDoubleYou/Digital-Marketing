# Digital-Marketing
A portfolio of the digital marketing projects I have done to date, including a portfolio of projects completed for Udacity's Digital Marketing Nanodegree and Business Analytics Nanodegree certifications.
# 1. B2B Market Preparation
In this project, I designed the marketing objective, KPI, and value proposition for Udacity's Enterprise training program and conducted a survey, designed an empathy map, and created a target persona from interview data.
# 2. Marketing Myself
For this effort, I created a marketing strategy for myself, creating a blog post to highlight my reasons for pivoting from a career in management consulting to digital marketing.
# 3. Facebook Ad Campaign (Part 1)
I designed a B2B marketing approach to target professionals interested in digital marketing training programs for their organization using Facebook Ads Manager.
# 4. Facebook Ad Campaign (Part 2)
In the second part of this campaign, I analyzed and presented campaign metrics against the marketing objective and KPI to assess the effectiveness of my marketing approach.
